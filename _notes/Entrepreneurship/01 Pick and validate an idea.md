---

# Objective: 
Learn to pick and validate an idea that may generates sales on Day 1 and draws investor's check book at very early-stage of startup. 


# Steps: 
Below are the steps that may not be intuitive, but are used by experienced investors or accelerators coaching the startup they mentor and invest in


## Step 1: Does your idea fulfill one of the following? (idea that attracts customer)
An million dollar idea starts with one of the following
* 1 > solve a urgent problem that impacts a million people:
> attempt to solve a problem that requires immediate solution to remove the physical or emotional pain (e.g. out of physical shape which your significant other would not want to take the wedding photo with you) point in order to achieve the desire state (e.g lose 5kg in 3 months in order to look pretty at your own wedding photo shoooting)

* 2> be hired to complete a urgent job
> be the person to be called and be hired to complete a job that leads to a desire state. (e.g. the bathroom tub broke down and the smell is unbearble. your company is the first to be reminded or during inquery became the top choice to be hired to complete the job)

* 3> fulfill a immediate hard need 
> addressing the need  which existed in the past and continue to exist for the next 300 years (e.g. drinking water, go for higher learning or education, have a great physic or look)

## Step 2: Create an offer to validate (idea that people want to pay)

* The best validation comes when there is actual pre-sales or sales on a good-enough offer that people actually pays. 
* The offer is not the product / service that the company will eventually ship out or scale with.  The offer may be a semi-finished solution which may be good enough at early-stage of launch to make sure customer is willing to use and pay. (e.g. Groupon) 
	* Offer: Groupon started with a wordpress website to showcase the promotion of steakhouse, which did not have platform with online payment.)
	* Product/Service: A searchble e-commerce website that offers the best promotion in town with online payment and email coupon delivery. 



## Step 3: Understand why people buy from you (the killer reason that your idea may go big)

* It is critical to understad the market insight which is simply means why people buy from you. 
* This is actually not obvious to find out unless we start to ask the following question. 

	* why current product or service on the market can not solve


## Step 4: Is there actually an urgency to achieve the desire state? (potential of charging on value and not cost)

* Urgency increases chances that potential or existing customer to come to you and embrance your not-yet-perfect product or service, especially when current solution can not solve the problem or complete the job 

## Step 5: What is your unfair advange? (reason why you)

* does your  idea equiped wtih the following traits to build an entry barrier or makes hard for other to enter? 

* Amazing founders of experts 
* Market that increases by itselfs by 20% every year
* Are you able to make sales to your offer without advertsing inititially?

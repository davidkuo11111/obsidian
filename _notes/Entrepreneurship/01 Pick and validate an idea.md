title: How to pick and validate an million dollars idea?
---

# A. Objective: 
Learn to pick and validate an idea that may generate sales on Day 1 and draws an investor's attention to investing at the very early stage of a startup. 


# B. Steps: 
Below are the steps that may not be intuitive but are used by experienced investors or accelerators coaching the startup they mentor and invest in

## Step 1: Does your idea fulfill one of the following? (the idea that attracts customers)

A million-dollar idea starts with one of the following.
* 1 > solve an urgent problem that impacts a million people:
> attempt to solve a problem that requires an immediate solution to remove the physical or emotional pain (e.g., out of physical shape which your significant other would not want to take the wedding photo with you) point to achieve the desired state (e.g. lose 5kg in 3 months to look pretty at your wedding photo shooting)

* 2> be hired to complete an urgent job
> be the person to be called and be employed to complete a job that leads to the desired state. (e.g., the bathroom tub broke down, and the smell is unbearable. Your company is the first to be reminded of during inquiry and became the top choice to be hired to complete the job)

* 3> fulfill an immediate hard need 
> addressing the need  which existed in the past and will continue to exist for the next 300 years (e.g., drinking water, going for higher learning or education, having great physic or look)

## Step 2: Create an offer to validate (the idea that people want to pay)

* The best validation comes when there are actual pre-sales or sales on a good-enough offer that people pay. 
* The offer is not the product/service the company will eventually ship out or scale with. The request may be a semi-finished solution that may be good enough at the early launch stage to ensure the customer is willing to use and pay. (e.g., Groupon) 
	* Offer: Groupon started with a WordPress website to showcase the promotion of steakhouse, which did not have a platform with online payment.)
	* Product/Service: A searchable e-commerce website offering the best town promotion with online payment and email coupon delivery. 



## Step 3: Understand why people buy from you (the killer reason that your idea may go big)

* It is critical to understand the market insight, which means why people buy from you. 
* This is not obvious to find out unless we start asking the following question. 

	* why current product or service on the market can not solve


## Step 4: Is there an urgency to achieve the desired state? (potential of charging on value and not cost)

* Urgency increases the chances that potential or existing customers to come to you and embrace your not-yet-perfect product or service, especially when the current solution can not solve the problem or complete the job 

## Step 5: What is your unfair advantage? (the reason why you)

* Is your idea equipped with the following traits to build an entry barrier, or make it hard for others to enter? 
* A group of outstanding world-class experts who know the problem or have potential solutions can solve it.  
* Entering into a market with at least 20% growth every year
* Can you make sales and generate growing revenue without paid advertising? 
* Do your initial customer come back to buy, or does your product/service have recurring revenue?
